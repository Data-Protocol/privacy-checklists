# Privacy Checklists

## Introduction

Privacy Checklists combines the concept of "Jobs To be Done" with the concept of "Checklists". When complicated domains need to execute at scale with high quality and minimum mistakes, checklists are proven to dramatically change outcomes for the better, while increasing teamwork and cooperation.

To contribute or modify an existing checklist please follow the instructions in the [checklists-data directory](/checklists-data/README.md).

The checklists are provided in a JSON format to allow the content to be pulled and displayed elsewhere with ease. Included is a presentation layer to convert the json files into best practice human readable checklists. The tool will run automatically when checklists are added or updated in the githib repo. To manually update in your local copy go to the root repo directory and run

```/bin/sh
npm run gen-checklists
```

The markdown checklists are generated in the [docs](./docs) folder.
