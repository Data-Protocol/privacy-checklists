# Checklist Data

## Introduction

The implementation of simple checklists in complex domains has seen dramatic improvements in results and outcomes.

For example;

- When checklists have been implemented for use by surgical teams, deaths dropped 40 percent ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/health/20surgery.html)).
- Every [pilot runs a pre-flight checklist](https://www.aopa.org/training-and-safety/students/presolo/skills/before-takeoff-checklist) before they are allowed to leave the ground.

Mission critical, complex jobs and processes have implemented checklists and the outcomes have dramatically improved.

A good checklist is not complicated, it should fit on one page, with between 5-9 items, which aligns with the natural limit of working memory in humans. And the language should be familiar to the profession.

Each checklist is submitted as a structured json doc by adding a new json file to this directory and submitting a pull request. We do this so the document presentation of the checklist can be generated by the embedded SDK and kept as clean as possible.

Also the checklists can be embedded in other presentations and websites, and by anybody. All content in this repository is licensed under [Creative Commons](/LICENSE).

A good checklist is precise, efficient, and easy to use even in the most difficult situations. It should provide reminders of only the most important steps, rather than trying to spell out everythingâ€”after all, a checklist can't do your job for you. And above all, a checklist should be practical.
