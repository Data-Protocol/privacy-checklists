## Introduction

This is a community driven project to create the best developer checklists to avoid making mistakes and being wrong. The impact of software engineering on the world has been transformational.There are 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created each day, and 90 percent of the data in the world was generated in the last two years ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/?sh=42543fe860ba)).

Now that so many of people's daily lives are touched in some way by technology, there is a growing call to better regulate the industry, to protect personal data and empower individuals in the management of their personal data.

It is impossible for software developers to learn and monitor the ever increasing number of data privacy laws across the world, as the technology sector becomes more and more regulated.

However, shipping never stops whilst the risk repercussions of making privacy related mistakes are exponentially increasing.

The Privacy Checklists Project is released under Creative Commons CC BY-SA license with the goal of equipping developers to build data products with confidence, and control their own domain, even when time is pressured.

Privacy Checklists combines the concept of "Jobs To be Done" with the concept of "Checklists". When complicated domains need to execute at scale with high quality and minimum mistakes, checklists are proven to dramatically change outcomes for the better, while increasing teamwork and cooperation.

The checklists are provided in a JSON format to allow the content to be pulled and displayed elsewhere with ease. Included is a presentation layer to convert the json files into best practice human readable checklists.

## Jobs to be done & Checklists

1: Jobs To Be Done
Existing privacy help and advice is orientated around the legal and policy concepts found in regulations, using the language and process of lawyers. Developers need privacy tools that align with existing software development processes, language, and tasks.

2: Checklists
The implementation of simple checklists in complex domains has seen dramatic improvements in results and outcomes.

For example;

- When checklists have been implemented for use by surgical teams, deaths dropped 40 percent ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/health/20surgery.html)).
- Every [pilot runs a pre-flight checklist](https://www.aopa.org/training-and-safety/students/presolo/skills/before-takeoff-checklist) before they are allowed to leave the ground.

Mission critical, complex jobs and processes have implemented checklists and the outcomes have dramatically improved.

To quote "[The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right](https://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right-ebook/dp/B0030V0PEW/ref=sr_1_1?crid=118YTNHN89QT7&dchild=1&keywords=the+checklist+manifesto&qid=1623581469&sprefix=the+checklist+m%2Caps%2C210&sr=8-1)" by Atul Gawande.

> “The volume and complexity of what we know has exceeded our individual ability to deliver its benefits correctly, safely, or reliably. Knowledge has both saved us and burdened us.”
> “Checklists seem to provide protection against failures. They remind us of the minimum necessary steps and make them explicit. They not only offer the possibility of verification but also instill a kind of discipline of higher performance.”

## Community Contributions

We need your contributions to improve these tools.

The project welcomes all offers of help including improving the provided check lists, creating additional checklists, improved presentation tooling, and your thoughts and recommendations for wider ecosystem integration & adoption.

Follow the instructions in the [checklists-data directory](/checklists-data/README.md) on submitting a checklist for inclusion.
